These launch files allow bag files of choice, which exist within this directory, to be run under a variety of different conditions.
Each launch file has 2 variables which allow different bag files to be run, or for these scripts to run on other laptops.

call:
roslaunch human_detection launchfile.launch user:=$USER bag_file:=bagfile.bag

to initialise the launch file with bagfile bagfile.bag, from the directory with at /home/$USER/cued-masters/src/qbo_sigproc/human_detection/bagfiles/

playall.launch:
 - launch rosbag play with the bag_file and the node human_detection_2 - for demonstrating run-time detection

playbag.launch: 
 - launch rosbag play with the bag_file and nothing else

playallwValgrind.launch:
 - as playall.launch, but running Valgrind to evaluated performance convert_bag_to_frames.launch - launches rosbag play with bag_file and node 'save_metric_frames' which saves each frame as an individual openCV floating point matrix for use in training and tagging. Frames are written to the directory DATADIR/bag_file/FRAMES as defined in config.h when the node is compiled. To change these directories, change the config file and run catkin_make from the cued-masters directory.

seebag.launch:
 - launch rosbag play with image_view. Good for verifying that a bag file works, and to visualise its content. Note that this launch file is not designed to be called directly, but from the bash file "testbag.bash" in human_detection/bagfiles/.
