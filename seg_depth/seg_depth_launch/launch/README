To run the simulation of using openni to create its default topics from only the raw data, run

source openni_sim.bash

This will set the time params and then call openni_sim.launch, a launch file to launch openni without the drivers,
to launch the bag file in ../bagfiles/raw.bag and the node seg_color, to demonstrate segmentation.
